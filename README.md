Simple Android game built to run on Facebook Instant Games. 

Based off of the hit game "Doodle Jump," Lunatic Jump combines the neverending platform jumping 
of Doodle Jump with a clever twist that has players yell at the microphone to move the player 
left or right. 

This game even has multiplayer capabilities to allow different Facebook users to communicate and 
yell together to move the character left or right, requiring collaboration and teamwork.
